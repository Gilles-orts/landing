			<h2>Mission statement:<h2>
			<p>More than 80% of girls and women feel unsafe at parties and that doesn't come out of nowhere. Spiking drinks is a very common issue people do not talk enough about or address in a proper manner. As group of 10 young adults who are trying to make the society around us better, we came up with ecological & fun cup-condoms that will make you and your friends feel safer wherever you go: bars, bday parties, school parties, etc. 
			</p>

			<h2>How to recognize you have been drugged:<h2>
			<p>Some spiking symptoms that will help you recognize faster if you're a victim & try to get help as soon as you feel in danger are: mental confusion, memory loss, breathing problems, nausea & vomiting, speech difficulties, severe and logner than usual hangover.
